# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
Analysis done for a School District to provide performance trends and patterns on student funding and students' standardized test scores based on school performance. This analysis attempts to assist the school board in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. The analysis was done by completing the following tasks:

  1.  Creating a DataFrame with the district summary.
  2.  Creating a DataFrame with the school summary.
  3.  Identifying the Top 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate.
  4.  Identifying the Bottom 4 schools based on the overall passing rate.
  5.  Calculating the average Math score for each grade level from each school.
  6.  Calculating the average Reading score for each grade level from each school.
  7.  Calculating the scores by school spending per student.
  8.  Calculating the scores by school size.
  9.  Calculating the scores by school type.

Finally, after performing these analysis I was notified that there was evidende of academic dishonesty for specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. As a result, the above tasks had to be repited after replacing the altered data with NaNs. The final results and project analysis are based in the comparison of the two versions of the data to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
